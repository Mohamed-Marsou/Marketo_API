## Vue.js Frontend

The frontend of Marketo is built using Vue.js 3, a popular JavaScript framework for building dynamic and reactive web applications. The Vue.js frontend provides a smooth and responsive user interface, offering features such as wishlist management, shopping cart functionality, and multi-language support.

## Laravel Backend API

The Laravel backend serves as the API for the Vue.js frontend, providing data and functionalities to interact with the PostgreSQL database. This backend API is built using Laravel, a powerful PHP framework known for its elegant syntax and robust features. It handles various aspects of the e-commerce process, including product management, order processing, and customer management.

## Restful API Design

The backend API of Marketo follows the principles of a RESTful API, ensuring a clean and standardized approach to data communication. It utilizes REST (Representational State Transfer) principles to enable stateless and scalable communication between the frontend and backend. By adopting RESTful design principles, Marketo achieves a high level of interoperability,
